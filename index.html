                <h1>What Led Me to Launch Code</h1>

                <p>Hi! Thanks for stopping by. This is a story about my professional journey so far. Doesn't that sound so nice and intentional? Let's face it, there are a blessed few of us out there who knew what they wanted to be when they grow up and
                    went out there and did it. Those lucky assholes..
                </p>

                <p>The rest of us must figure things out. You know, make a few mistakes, taste a few victories and try and make sense of this mess we're all in. This is a story that is still being written, a work in progress. Here’s a bit about where I’ve
                    been and where (I think) I’m headed now.</p>
