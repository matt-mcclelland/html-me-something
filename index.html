                        <h1>What Led Me to Launch Code</h1>

                        <p>Hi! Thanks for stopping by. This is a story about my professional journey so far. Doesn't that sound so nice and intentional? Let's face it, there are a blessed few of us out there who knew what they wanted to be when they grow
                            up. I am not one of those people.
                        </p>

                        <p>The rest of us must figure things out. You know, make a few mistakes, taste a few victories and try and make sense of this mess we're all in. This is a story that is still being written, a work in progress. We won't get into all
                            the jobs and experiences that got me here. Ain't no one got the time for that! Here are some of the high lights and a bit about where, I think, I'm headed.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div id="emt">

                        <h2>EMT - Springfield, MO</h2>

                        <p>I graduated a semester early from Kickapoo High School in Springfield, MO. Someone asked me once what I was going to do next. "I don't know. Maybe drive an ambulance?" I said.</p>

                        <p>I can't recall who asked me but I remember their reply: "There's no way <em>YOU</em> can be an EMT!" </p>

                        <img src="C:\Users\mcclellandm\lc101\html-me-something\images\ambulance.jpg" alt="ambulance" width="50%" />

                        <p>For a time, I was the youngest EMT in the state of Missouri. I attended Springfield Community College for a semester and passed my exam. But, I did not last long in the emergency medical field. Quickly, I learned that I did not
                            have the stomach for it. Mad respect to those who do that job. They're a rare breed.</p>

                    </div>

                    <div id="canoe">

                        <h2>Wilderness EMT/Canoe Guide - International Falls, MN</h2>

                        <p>Not knowing what to do after my brief stint in emergency medicine, I obtained my WEMT license and went to work at a summer camp I had the privilege of attending through their scholarship program. My job was to lead young men on
                            challenge oriented 200 mile canoe trips in Ontario for two weeks at a time. </p>

                        <p>I loved this job! I was able to spend several years making it happen by working odd jobs during the year and attending school off and on. I would do it full-time if it weren't a seasonal position. The best way to get to know yourself
                            and your team is to spend two weeks with them in the Wilderness. I learned a lot about being a leader out there and a lot about limits, both physical and mental. </p>
                    </div>

                    <div id="barista">

                        <h2>The Barista Years - St Louis, MO</h2>

                        <p>I moved to St Louis on a whim and was lucky get a job as a Shift Supervisor at Starbucks. I found out later that my manager had hired me (an outside hire) as a punishment to her staff because she felt that no one deserved the managerial
                            role. My team hated me at first. Teaching your Supervisor how to do basic things like run the espresso machine can breed resentment in a crew. </p>

                        <p>I made it a little less than two years. Although, I eventually earned the respect of my team, I was miserable. People who have not had their morning coffee can be downright mean! I also began answering drive through orders in my
                            sleep. That coupled with the 4:30 AM start time lead to this feeling of always being at work.</p>

                        <p>I worked at another coffee shop in Maplewood following the Starbucks gig. I was back leading trips in the summer. Tired of being broke and dissatisfied with my lot in life, I took a position as assistant manager at a cupcake shop.
                            The money was decent, and I skipped out on Minnesota for about two years. Again, I learned a lot.</p>

                        <div id="cupcake">

                            <h2>Night Manager at a Cupcake Shop - St Louis, MO</h2>

                            <p>Part of my job was to created a coffee program for the company and train the staff how to make espresso. We even invented seasonal drinks. This job also led me to one of the coolest experiences of my life.</p>

                            <p>Once, I got a call from someone in Snoop Dogg's circle asking if they could order 2 dozen cupcakes. To which I replied, "Bullshit! Why are you messing with me?" The guy was like, I'm serious look it up he's playing tonight
                                at Pop's. Sure enough, he was. I offered to comp the cupcakes in exchange for putting me and my crew on the list and he agreed!</p>

                            <p>The general culture of this company was, at the time, very dconservative and churchy. No one would go with me. No one except one girl who did not hate fun. Baby T was younger than me, very attractive, African American, and
                                (because her grandfather owned a car lot) drove a white Mercedes Benz. There are few times I recall ever feeling cooler than I did that night. Pulling up to the show, stepping out of that car with Baby T, walking up, skipping
                                the line and saying, "We're on the list.," and knowing that Snoop D O Double G had enjoyed our cupcakes. It was a blast and one hell of a show!</p>

                            <div id="stepdad">

                                <h2>Step – Dad, Server, Bartender – St Louis, MO</h2>

                                <p>The next significant professional moment came when I met my partner and became a stepparent to two boys. To those of you who do not have children, let me tell you being a parent is a full-time job. I quickly realized that
                                    I needed to get my shit together and find a career!</p>
                                <p>When I was younger, I had always enjoyed tinkering around with computers. After some research, I decided that Information Technology was a field that I could quickly make money in. Network engineers could get hired with
                                    a cert so, I began night school at Forest Park working toward my CCNA. These classes were very difficult, so I went back to serving and bartending at Pi Pizzeria to make time for me to study network engineering. </p>
                                <p>I ended up working to morning coffee bar at the location in CWE. Once day I was making a drink for a regular and asked him if he knew where I could get an internship in networking. To my surprise he said, that his brother
                                    owned a communications company and I could work for him or he himself owned a small SEO company and I could intern there. After Googling what SEO was, I accepted his offer. </p>

                                <div id="seo">

                                    <h2>Intern, SEO Specialist – St Louis, MO</h2>
                                    <p>I worked at Pi, attended night school and when I wasn’t at work or school I was at my internship. I was an unpaid intern for a year before I began pulling $10/hr and working nearly full-time. I found that I loved web
                                        sites, analytics and helping business represent themselves on the web. </p>
                                    <p>Here I learned HTML and a little bit of CSS. We used the Joomla CMS on our sites. There was only 1 other person working there, we will call him Rick and he was the Head Developer. Rick had a computer science degree
                                        and did most of the heavy lifting on the sites. My job was mostly to write blogs about things like “Basement Repair in St Louis” or working on resolving clients Name Address and Phone (NAP) listing conflicts. Eventually,
                                        it was my job to speak with the clients because Rick did not like to do so. </p>
                                    <p>Although Rick had a CS degree, he was a self-taught SEO. His philosophy was something like, I had to learn this the hard way, so you do too. I taught myself Word Press and using mostly visual editors was able to create
                                        sites that would rank due to my knowledge of SEO structure and best practices. Eventually, I held the title of Jr. Developer. Now, this might sound impressive, but I was a hack developer but a decent SEO. The server
                                        side of websites was a complete mystery to me. </p>
                                    <p>After a while, I became frustrated with Rick. He began gaming after getting a random $1000 tip on Twitch. Gaming really took over his life. Often, he didn’t show up to work. When he did show up it was super late, and
                                        he was worthless because he’d been up all-night gaming. Eventually he stopped doing much of anything at work and we were losing clients. Feeling I was on a sinking ship, I took a position with an acquaintance in
                                        Springfield, MO who had an SEO company there. </p>
                                    <p>My friend in Springfield oversold his company. He lost a client or two and I did not get paid for several months of work. To this day, he owes me several thousand dollars. Having been thoroughly defeated, broken I gave
                                        up SEO and any sort of development. </p>
                                    <p>We struggled for a few months before my partner and I took a job managing the kitchen at the summer camp that I used to lead canoe trips for. The kitchen paid nearly triple what guide work did and we were able to bring
                                        our boys up to camp so they could experience the program. </p>

                                    <div id="cbc">

                                        <h2>Help Desk, CBCHS - St Louis, MO</h2>
                                        <p>A friend was able to pull some strings and I landed at the Help Desk at CBC High School. It was nice to pull a paycheck and some benefits. I’m super thankful for this job but there is no room for advancement. There
                                            are 3 other people in the department and they plan on retiring here. </p>
                                        <p>I still missed restaurant work and we definitely needed extra money so I took a gig bartending for a high end catering company as well. Both Anna and I work bartending gigs on the weekends on top of full-time jobs.
                                            We’ve been fortunate to have jobs that allowed us to continue to work for camp in the summers. So we continued to work summers up north because we love it up there and it was super important for us that the
                                            boys continued to go camp. Although working on an island half a mile from the Canadian border sounds like a vacation, it’s 14 days 7 days a week for 10 weeks with 1 day off. </p>
                                        <p>I also began to miss making websites and began to freelance on the side of my side gig. That’s when I began looking at coding bootcamps. I am not in the position to go back to school financially and most jobs for
                                            developers require a college degree or completion of a coding bootcamp. That’s when I discovered Launch Code. After my third application, here I am. </p>

                                    </div>

                                    <div id="lc101">

                                        <h2> Launch Code – What’s Next?</h2>
                                        <p>I’ve already learned so much here. Super stoked to be learning more and filling in the gaps in my skill set. So where do I see myself after LC? I’ve become very passionate about UX and UI from my background in SEO
                                            where often the goal was to get someone to buy something or join a mailing list etc. I really love analytics and helping people get found on the internet. Working for Rick and myself, I’ve developed project
                                            management skills. I’m not graphic designer but I feel I’ve got a good head for functional design. Having been a bartender, I’ve got good people skills. </p>
                                        <p>Long story short, I still don’t know exactly what I want to do after Launch Code. I’m anxious to learn more about various kinds of development positions and where I might fit in. I’m on the fence about attempting
                                            to start my own agency. All I know, is that I want to create badass site and applications, work with people, and make more bank. </p>
